# Guess-the-Country-Game-Client

## Project Overview
The React Client for "Guess the Country Game" is the front-end application that complements the backend API to create an interactive and engaging country guessing game. Players can guess randomly selected countries based on dynamically generated hints, with difficulty levels affecting the game's complexity.

This repository contains the client-side application, built using React, and communicates with the backend server for data and game logic.

## Requirements
This project requires the backend server to function. You can find the backend repository and setup instructions here:

Ensure both the React Client and Backend Server are running on the same system or properly configured to communicate.
